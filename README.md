# Supermarket Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project for supermarket sales data. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic data exploration, visualization, and insights derivation. It is aimed at beginner data science students who want to understand how to approach and perform EDA on real-world datasets.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will perform the following steps:

- Data Loading and Overview: Load the dataset and display its structure.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.
- Data Exploration:
- Summary statistics of numerical and categorical features.
- Correlation analysis.
- Visualization: Create plots to understand patterns and distributions in the data.
- Insights: Extract insights that can inform business decisions.

## Tools and Libraries

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: for data visualization
- **NumPy**: for numerical computations

## Dataset

Link to data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales
The dataset contains sales data from a supermarket. Each row represents a transaction, and each column contains attributes related to the transaction, such as:

- Invoice ID: The unique identifier for each transaction.
- Branch: The branch of the supermarket where the sale took place.
- Customer Type: The type of customer (Member/Non-member).
- Gender: Gender of the customer.
- Product Line: The category of products purchased.
- Total: Total sales amount.
- Date: Date of the transaction.
More columns and features are detailed in the notebook.


## How to Use

- Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supermarket-sales-eda.git
- Navigate to the project directory:
cd supermarket-sales-eda
- Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook EDA_Supermarket_Sales_Notebook.ipynb

Follow along with the notebook to see the steps involved in the EDA process.

## Key Insights

Some of the key insights found in the dataset include:

Sales Trends: Patterns in sales over time.
Branch Performance: Comparison of sales across different supermarket branches.
Customer Demographics: Gender and customer type distribution.
Product Preferences: Popularity of different product lines.

## Conclusion

This EDA project provides a foundation for analyzing and visualizing real-world data. By the end of this analysis, you will have a better understanding of the process of EDA, its common analysis, and how to uncover insights from raw data.
